Valid Mathematical Functions

- a+b: add two numbers

- a-b: subtraction, unary negative has variable behaviour, for safety use brackets

- a*b: multiplication

- a/b: division (left-assosciative)

- a^b: exponenentiation (right-assosciative)


## Trigonometric Functions
sin(z) cos(z) tan(z)


## Hyperbolic Functions
sinh(z) cosh(z) tanh(z)


## Inverse Trig & Hyp Functions
These use the principle value.
asin(z) acos(z) atan(z)
asinh(z) acosh(z) atanh(z)


## If possible use these rather than alternatives like ^
square(z) sqrt(z) exp(z) 


ln(z) log(z,base) root(z)

## Complex Number Stuff
re(z) im(z)
mag(z) arg(z)

pi,e evaluate as you'd expect. exp(z) is more accurate than e^z
